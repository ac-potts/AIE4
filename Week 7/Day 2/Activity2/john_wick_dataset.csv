3,What event triggers John Wick's quest for revenge in the film?,"["": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""]",The event that triggers John Wick's quest for revenge in the film is the brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past.,simple,"[{'source': 'c:\\Users\\andre\\OneDrive\\Documents\\AIE4\\AIE4\\Week 7\\Day 2\\jw1.csv', 'row': 9, 'Review_Date': '20 October 2014', 'Review_Title': "" The coolest action film you'll see all year\n"", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3107759/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'trublu215', 'Rating': 9, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 24, 11, 20, 51, 285882)}]",True

And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades.

16,What sets John Wick apart from typical American action films in terms of script and direction?,"["": 10\nReview: Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame."", "": 17\nReview: Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.""]","John Wick sets itself apart from typical American action films through its innovative direction by Chad Stahelski and a screenplay that avoids the pitfalls of poor writing and overreliance on computer-generated imagery. The franchise is noted for its ability to innovate and thrill with each new entry, distinguishing it from the more formulaic offerings in the genre.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'c:\\Users\\andre\\OneDrive\\Documents\\AIE4\\AIE4\\Week 7\\Day 2\\jw4.csv', 'row': 10, 'Review_Date': '22 March 2023', 'Review_Title': ' How Can Anyone Choose to Watch Marvel Over This?\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw8944843/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'lovemichaeljordan', 'Rating': 8, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 4', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 27, 11, 20, 51, 419531)}, {'source': 'c:\\Users\\andre\\OneDrive\\Documents\\AIE4\\AIE4\\Week 7\\Day 2\\jw4.csv', 'row': 17, 'Review_Date': '16 March 2023', 'Review_Title': ' While the Wick franchise has already solidified itself one of the best in the action genre, this massive film is the most spectacular entry of the genre in 30 years.\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw8932278/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'tresm87', 'Rating': 9, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 4', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 27, 11, 20, 51, 419531)}]",True
17,What makes John Wick different from usual action heroes?,"[': 5\nReview: The first John Wick film was special because it broke a mold of sorts.

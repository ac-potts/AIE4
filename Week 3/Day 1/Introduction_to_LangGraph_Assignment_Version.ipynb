        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model needs to produce responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in question-answering systems, chatbots, and other applications requiring detailed and accurate information retrieval.'"

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval, such as TF-IDF, BM25, or more advanced neural retrieval models, to find the most relevant content.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved documents and the input query. It typically uses a sequence-to-sequence model, such as a Transformer-based model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Integration**: The retrieved documents are used to inform and guide the generation process. The generation model can use the retrieved information to produce more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses. This integration can be done in various ways, such as concatenating the retrieved documents with the input query or using attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the retrieved content.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG Systems\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG systems can generate responses that are more relevant and accurate.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: They can incorporate up-to-date information from large corpora, making them useful for tasks that require current knowledge.\\n- **Flexibility**: They can be applied to various domains, including question answering, dialogue systems, and content generation.\\n\\n### Applications\\n- **Customer Support**: Providing accurate and contextually relevant answers to customer queries.\\n- **Educational Tools**: Assisting with homework or providing explanations on various topics.\\n- **Content Creation**: Generating articles, summaries, or other forms of content based on a given topic.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to produce high-quality, informative, and contextually appropriate responses.\",\n",

It introduces several significant improvements:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that are much smaller in size, making the fine-tuning process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Modularity**: LoRA allows for modular updates to the model. This means that different tasks can have their own low-rank adaptations, which can be swapped in and out without retraining the entire model. This modularity is useful for multi-task learning and transfer learning.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain, and in some cases even improve, the performance of the fine-tuned models. This makes it a practical choice for many applications.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA is particularly advantageous when scaling up to very large models, where traditional fine-tuning methods become impractical due to the sheer number of parameters involved.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a valuable technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models while maintaining high performance.',\n",

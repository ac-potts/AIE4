# Deploying Pythonic Chat With Your Text File Application

In today's breakout rooms, we will be following the processed that you saw during the challenge - for reference, the instructions for that are available [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT/tree/main).

Today, we will repeat the same process - but powered by our Pythonic RAG implementation we created last week. 

You'll notice a few differences in the `app.py` logic - as well as a few changes to the `aimakerspace` package to get things working smoothly with Chainlit.

## Reference Diagram (It's Busy, but it works)

## Deploying the Application to Hugging Face Space

Due to the way the repository is created - it should be straightforward to deploy this to a Hugging Face Space!

> NOTE: If you wish to go through the local deployments using `chainlit run app.py` and Docker - please feel free to do so!

<details>
    <summary>Creating a Hugging Face Space</summary>

1.  Navigate to the `Spaces` tab.

> NOTE: The address is the component that starts with `git@hf.co:spaces/`.

2. Use the command:

```bash
git remote add hf HF_SPACE_SSH_ADDRESS_HERE
```

3. Use the command:

```bash
git pull hf main --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories -X ours
```

4. Use the command: 

```bash 
git add .
```

5. Use the command:

```bash
git commit -m "Deploying Pythonic RAG"
```

6. Use the command: 

```bash
git push hf main
```

7. The Space should automatically build as soon as the push is completed!

> NOTE: The build will fail before you complete the following steps!

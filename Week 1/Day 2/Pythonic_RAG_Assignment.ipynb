            "### For Loop\n",
            "A `for` loop is typically used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). Here’s a basic example:\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(f\"Current fruit: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### While Loop\n",
            "A `while` loop is used when you want to repeat an action until a certain condition is no longer true. Here's a simple example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a while loop\n",

            "\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(f\"Count is: {count}\")\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Best Practices\n",
            "1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose meaningful variable names that make your loop's purpose clear.\n",
            "2. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Ensure your loop has a proper exit strategy (especially for `while` loops).\n",
            "3. **Use `enumerate`**: When you need a counter while looping over a sequence, you can use `enumerate()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Use List Comprehensions**: If you are generating a list from another list, consider using list comprehensions, which are more concise:\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   print(squares)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Readability**: Always prioritize readability. Sometimes a simple and clear loop is better than a complex one that is difficult to understand at a glance.\n",
